# Project Overview

## Project Goal

Build a scalable Node.js REST API backend using Express.js with clean architecture principles, standardized error handling, modular domain organization, reusable data-access patterns, and production-ready authentication/authorization flows.

The project focuses on:
- Clean backend architecture
- Scalable module organization
- Standardized API patterns
- Separation of concerns
- Maintainable Express.js structure
- Incremental architecture evolution
- Long-term scalability

## Current Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Joi
- JWT
- bcrypt
- Jest
- Supertest
- Helmet
- CORS
- Nodemon

## Current Architecture Status

The project currently implements:

### Infrastructure
- Environment configuration validation
- MongoDB connection management

### Application Foundation
- Express application bootstrap
- Modular route registration
- API versioning support

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling
- AppError operational error pattern
- Standardized error response contract

### Security Foundation
- Helmet integration
- CORS integration
- Request size limiting
- JWT authentication middleware

### Data Access Layer
- Repository pattern
- BaseRepository abstraction
- Pagination utilities
- Query filtering utilities

### Testing Foundation
- Jest test infrastructure
- Supertest integration testing
- Unit testing conventions

### User Management
- User module foundation
- User profile management
- Pagination-ready user listing
- User profile update workflow
- Safe user DTO mapping

### Authorization Foundation
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Admin role support
- Authorization middleware
- Route-level authorization enforcement

### Authorization Policy System
- Policy-based authorization foundation
- Centralized permission evaluation
- Role-to-permission mapping
- Permission middleware abstraction
- Resource access policy preparation

## Architectural Principles

- Thin route layer
- HTTP-only controllers
- Service-based business logic
- Repository-owned database access
- Middleware-only validation
- Centralized error handling
- Standardized JSON responses
- Modular domain structure
- Incremental architecture evolution

## Current Development Phase

Phase 16 — Authorization Policy System

Current goals:
- Introduce role-based authorization
- Separate authentication vs authorization responsibilities
- Add reusable authorization middleware
- Prepare permission/policy architecture foundation
- Enforce role-aware protected routes

---

## Planned Next Phase

Refresh Token Session Management

Future goals:
- Long-lived authenticated sessions
- Token rotation support
- Session revocation
- Device-level authentication management

---

## Database Layer

Current database stack:
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

Current architecture includes:
- Repository abstraction
- Shared BaseRepository patterns
- Pagination utilities
- Query utilities
- Reusable filtering/sorting patterns

Current database responsibilities:
- Data persistence
- Query abstraction
- Pagination-ready querying
- Reusable repository patterns

Future direction:
Controller
→ Service
→ Authorization Policy
→ Repository
→ Database
